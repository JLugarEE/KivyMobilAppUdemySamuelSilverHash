# KivyMobilAppUdemySamuelSilverHash
Samuel Mthembo Udemo Kivy Python Mobil App Lessons Plus

Sorry, my first repository, something went wrong on DT push (didn't happen).
So the git manual push left my main file "Readme_First.txt" corrupted.

So, I paste it below so you can see my organization as a repository; note
I followed Samuel's lessons and left just the main.py, and other files where
his class was shown. I also, left all the *.py_Lesson* files in their original
folders too. More notes in the pasted "Readme_first.txt" file below:
